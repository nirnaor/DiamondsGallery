                        Our company is not made out of diamonds. It is made out of people. This is our crew.

                        <la>Junior </la>just joined the company a few weeks ago, but already feels in place. After being recruited to the team by his Father Alon , he began to show some interesting designs and ideas. When he's not designing new stuuf, youll find him hitting on cute blonde nurses in the hospital. He's defenitelly unexperienced, but he has a great future in front of him.
